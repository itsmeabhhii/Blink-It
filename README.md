# Blink-It
This is an application for the one's who have ability to communicate via eyes only.

# Usage of this App
Using this application in the tough warfare zones could be of greater advantage as soldiers can communicate with their officials via just a blink of eye.
This application is reliable as even there's no internet connection, it can still send the string types up via eye to the particular recipient.
# How it works (Just An Overview)
This application recognises the facial landmarks from a dat file named -> Shape Predictor 68 Face Landmarks. After successfully locating the person's eye it will then run through the code which is solely written in python language.<br/>
Another interesting fact is that this application would automagically locate up several files and then open them up in a wider screen angle (Shown in video too).
