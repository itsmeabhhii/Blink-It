# Blink-It
This is an application for the one's who have ability to communicate via eyes only.

# Usage of this App
Using this application in the <b/>Tough Warfare Zones</b> could be of greater advantage as soldiers can communicate with their officials via just a blink of eye.<br/>
This application is reliable as even there's no internet connection, it can still send the string types up via eye to the particular recipient.
# How it works (Just An Overview)
Majorly this application is based upon the Morse Code Language which is nothing but a sequence of dots and dashes.<br/><br/>
English characters and numbers are marked/mapped down to morse language with each of it having a different mapping.<br/>
This application recognises the facial landmarks from a dat file named -> Shape Predictor 68 Face Landmarks. After successfully locating the person's eye it will then run through the code which is solely written in python language.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting fact is that this application would automagically locate up several files and then open them up in a wider screen angle (Shown in video too).<br/>
<br/>This application would open up camera, a file which comprise of the mapping of english alphabets as well as numbers to the morse language.<br/>
